        <h2>Lab 2: Expressions and Operators</h2>
        <p>
            This lab will focus on exercising some of the topics covered in the textbook chapter, 
            specifically, data types, arithmetic operations, c-strings, and the random number generator.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you did in Lab 1, work in the editor of your choice to complete the exercises. Be sure
            to test that your code compiles using the standard <code>g++</code> compiler and test your
            code thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reminder: the standard formatted header comment block from module 1 will be required for all
            c++ files you submit.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you have completed all the exercises, ZIP up your lab folder and submit your 
            <code>Lab02.zip</code> containing the required .cpp and any README.md files.
