<h1>Welcome to class!</h1>
<p>Hi everybody and welcome to CS-181!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I'm looking forward to seeing everyone in class. In the meantime, you have access to the 
    Canvas course.
</p>
<p>
    I will be posting and e-mailing announcements, with notes and reminders of class activities 
    such as due dates, quizzes, exams, lab hints, etc. Be sure you are using an email address 
    that is current in Canvas, and it's one you check regularly.
</p>
<p>
    We will be meeting this semester weekly on

    <span>Tuesday evenings at Cuyamaca College in E 212.</span>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Here are a few quick class orientation items to help everybody get started.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>I'll be going over all of this in class, but go ahead and get started now.</li>
    <li>The lecture and lab for this course are integrated as a single class and there is 
        nly one course in Canvas so only one place to look.</li>
    <li>The class container on Canvas is up! Please feel free to browse around the pages 
        to get familiar with where things are. I am always making updates and edits to 
        the class materials. If you notice any errors, broken links, missing images, or 
        something that just doesn't look right, please let me know!</li>
    <li>Not all of the material will be available yet. It is not my intention to hold back
        material, but I am still working on getting everything ready for you. I will be 
        posting new material weekly as it becomes available.</li>
    </li>
    <li>Locate the class syllabus and outline. Be sure to review these right away.</li>
    <li>We will be starting the first week with the first two chapters in the text book.
        You'll want to have access to the book as soon as possible (if you don't already).
    </li>
    <li>Have a look at the first discussion activity, and get started with that. It's an 
        important exercise and it has points and a due date associated with it!</li>
    <li>Pay attention to due dates. My goal is to get timely feedback to you, but late 
        submissions make that much more difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Next...</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Go to Module 1 to get started!</li>
</ul>
