<h1>C++ Assignment: Grade Calculator</h1>

<p>
  Write a program that collects multiple assignment scores from the user, calculates the 
  average of those scores, and displays the corresponding letter grade. This program 
  must follow the structural and style guidelines used in previous labs.
</p>

<h2>Program Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Include the **standard header block** at the top of your <code>.cpp</code> file (same format used in earlier labs).</li>
  <li>All logic must be contained within <code>main()</code>. Do <strong>not</strong> write additional functions or methods.</li>
  <li>Use a **loop** to collect assignment scores as floating-point percentages (e.g., <code>87.5</code>).</li>
  <li>The loop must continue **as long as the user enters input that can be converted to a <code>double</code>**.</li>
  <li>When the user enters anything that is not a valid floating-point number, the loop ends.</li>
  <li>Keep a **running total** of all valid scores and maintain a **count** of how many scores were entered.</li>
  <li>After the loop ends, calculate and display the **average score**.</li>
  <li>Use an <code>if - else if - else</code> structure to convert the numeric average into a letter grade:
    <ul>
      <li>average ≥ 90 → A</li>
      <li>average ≥ 80 → B</li>
      <li>average ≥ 70 → C</li>
      <li>average ≥ 60 → D</li>
      <li>otherwise → F</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>No magic numbers:</strong> All numeric grade thresholds must be named constants declared at the top of <code>main()</code>.</li>
  <li>After displaying the average and letter grade, the program should end normally.</li>
</ul>

<div class="box">
  <strong>Input behavior:</strong><br>
  Prompt the user before each score. If they type a number (e.g., <code>91</code> or <code>72.4</code>), 
  it is added to the running total.  
  If they type anything else (e.g., <code>x</code>, <code>done</code>, or blank input), the loop ends.
</div>

<h2>Output Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Display the calculated average score.</li>
  <li>Display the letter grade determined by your <code>if / else if / else</code> logic.</li>
  <li>Output should be clear and readable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before You Submit</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Your header block is complete and correctly formatted.</li>
  <li>Your program compiles and runs without warnings.</li>
  <li>All values used in conditions are named constants.</li>
  <li>Loop collects scores until the user enters invalid numeric input.</li>
  <li>You use exactly one <code>if / else if / else</code> chain for letter-grade determination.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Output does not need to be rounded or printed with a specified precision.</li>
  <li>Only positive values, between 0 and 100 should be considered valid scores.</li>
  <li>Zero points is a valid score and should be added to the total and increment the count.</li>
</ul>
